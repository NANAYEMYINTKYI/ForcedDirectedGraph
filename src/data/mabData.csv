The intended dynamic media had to be invisible and unobtrusive, yet still be related to the architectural manifestation. The resulting wooden-like tonality can be intuitively interpreted as a materiality that is generated 'out of' the architecture itself.","The wooden window frames are re-interpreted as architectural 'instruments' that can be more authentically actuated, such as by the mechanical hammering motion of a small piston, electronically driven by a solenoid. The overall sound landscape consists of unique and ever-changing combinations of wooden sounds with different tones and rhythms.","By trial-and-error the passers-by are invited to 'discover' the functionality of the faíçade. When the basic functionality is understood passers-by can control the actuation of the faíçade and 'play'. When people are approaching each other, social interaction is anticipated. If they disperse and stop or don't socially interact, the soundscape will gradually vanish.","The architecture office is situated between the busy beltway of Leuven and the more quiet and peaceful Ruelenspark. A gradually changing urban soundscape characterizes the public passage along the DMOA office. Inspired by this contextual quality, sound was used as a 'medium' for the media faíçade, which would respect the subtle stamped concrete, yet be perceivable enough to facilitate interactions.","The content of the media faíçade, or what message it conveys relates to how the building itself communicates with its immediate environment. The responsive character allows the building to manifest itself in the socio-cultural fabric by stimulating social interaction with and between local residents, and by implying and accentuating the curved 'pull' movement of the front facade towards the park.","KU Leuven, KU Leuven, DMOA Architects, DMOA Architects, KU Leuven, KU Leuven",,Research[x]Design at KU Leuven and DMOA Architects,,,,,,,,,"Matthias Mattelaer, Benjamin Denef",,,,"Seventeen windows are equipped with a spring-actuated wooden block, which is agitated by an invisible and electronically controlled hammer.

RESTAURANT “NORMAL”,2018,"Ukraine, Kiev","""Normal"" is a restaurant in Kyiv, Ukraine. The concept of this place aims at changing the atmosphere in it depending on the restaurant schedule. The daylight scene is static and uses neutral tones; in the evening, however, the dynamics are added with more active color palette, and then it adds red in a nightclub mode, while the graffiti get supplemented by the content of different activity degrees to match the emotional state of one or another time of the day. 3D-mapping technology is used for animation of the graffiti. More than 30 variations of projections change themselves by special timings in consistency with common scenes of lighting. The backlight of the bar counter and the construction of scene and corridor are also dynamic and diverse. All of the lighting devices are controlled by a single specially designed system.","['#Ukraine', '#2018', '#Spatial media art']",https://awards.b-cdn.net/site_media/media/jurysys/media/66/1_big.jpg,https://awards.mediaarchitecture.org/mab/project/66,,,"YOD Design Lab, Kiev, Ukraine",,"Expolight, Dnipro, Ukraine","Expolight, Dnipro, Ukraine","Expolight, Dnipro, Ukraine","Expolight, Dnipro, Ukraine","Expolight, Dnipro, Ukraine",,,Multimedia LED light sources and 3D-mapping.,,,,"Expolight, Expolight, Normal, Expolight, Expolight, Expolight",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LTD.,,,,,,"UNIFUN's faíçade design is determined by two pre-determined notions, one is to display digital graphic information such as QR codes via LED pixel modules, the other is to compliment the cuboid volumes of the architecture form inspired by the structure of Rubik's Cube. In result, during daytime the faíçade with red and white details blends into the surroundings of the urban community. When the night falls, the lighting system embedded behind the joints of aluminum curtain walls dynamically illuminates the whole building. The aluminum panels that wrap around the Rubik's Cubes are of two different unit sizes, 1.3 meters wide square and 2.7 meters wide square. Meanwhile, the interactive media faíçade measuring around 2000 square meter QR codes or other visual content turns the community shopping center into a physical interface between people's iPhone screens and retail experience.","UNIFUN's corner multi-media faíçades consist of LED pixel modules connecting end to end with white textured glass on the exterior instead of the whole high resolution LED signage, mainly due to the restriction by city's urban planning regulations. The white and red lighting faíçades that complements the media cubes consist of matte LED strip lights embedded in the aluminum curtain walls, and the system adopted the DMX512 segment control technology. The entire faíçade can be easily edited and programmed to enrich the night cityscape daily.","The lighting transmitting behavior of UNIFUN's media faíçade relies on the matrix of LED pixel modules. The number of modules embedded inside is 133 times 960, which equals 127,680. The design restriction on LED screen usage may not be as conducive to display high resolution content as possible, on the other hand, the entire faíçade favors the aesthetic of QR codes, 8 bit video games and retro style of graphic, which echoes better with the geometric lines of the architecture form.","UNIFUN is located in Tianfu zone of Chengdu, the rapidly developed southwest China city. The district is currently expanding as the technology and scientific zone, as it's connected to a new central business district by means of an ecological corridor. In the newly-developed vertical communities, where adequate facilities and public spaces are often lacking, community retail center has the potential to become a convenient meeting place.

As society evolves rapidly, the use of innovative technologies by the City of Amsterdam is increasing. Smart technologies help the municipality to improve the quality of life in the city, to enhance safety, efficiency, sustainability and livability. Simultaneously, novel technologies could impact social values. The Responsible Sensing Lab explores how public and democratic values can be embedded in the design of innovations in public space. This contributes to the ambition by the City of Amsterdam to be a responsible, digital city.

Most often, there is no immediate benefit for citizens of collecting data. It's after data is processed, that it informs an action that affects citizens. Concerns about a sensor are often connected to concerns about potential action, and that the action has negative implications. Simple Sensors adresses this by: 1. Clear affordances that indicate what is measured 2. Real-time insight in how measurements are converted into data. 3. Show who is using data and for what purposes. 4. Indicate the intervals with which data is shared 5. Clear presence in public space as interface to city management 6. Invite people to verify if the sensor is working as intended. 7.

In combination with the luminescent chalk drawings, the laneway was turned into a magical space of glowing words and illustrations. A particular feature also emerged through the characteristic aesthetics of the robot's drawings in comparison to those made by people. (2) A low-resolution lighting display was integrated into the outer shell of the robot. The display is inspired by the aesthetics of low-resolution urban media facades.","The low-res lighting display is composed of 16 pixels in width and 4 pixels in height. The display is integrated into the robot's outer shell, completely encircling the spherical shape. The size of the pixels at the bottom row are approx. 100mm x 40mm, with pixels becoming more narrow and higher towards the top. To make each pixel cell distinguishable from another we designed a laser-cut waffle structure. For a homogeneous diffusion within each pixel cell, we added a white reflector sheet behind each LED, and a diffused sheet at the front of each cell. To maximise the diffusion and create a nice finish, we sandblasted the custom-made vacuum formed shell. Emissions of the surrounding UV lights increase the perceived contrast of the low-res display. The RGB LED system (as well as all other hardware components of the robot) are powered by a 12 voltage / 12Ah Lithium rechargeable battery.","Woodie was deployed for 17 evenings in a usually quiet laneway situated within Chatswood which is a major business and residential district of Sydney. The laneway connects a cultural centre and two large shopping malls. During the day, the lane is mainly used for the delivery of products to a nearby warehouse, however, during the time of the festival the lane was pedestrianised and closed for traffic. The designated area in which Woodie was drawing on the ground was roughly 15 metres in length and 5 metres in width. Despite the complexity of integrating urban robots into public spaces, we achieved that Woodie had not to be fenced off which allowed people to come close to it and even touch it. To not compromise the pedestrian flow, slowness emerged as an important feature for Woodie.","Video: https://vimeo.com/479453134 The video illustrates the motivation for the installation, critical aspects of the making process and on-site video recordings of the installation illustrating how people interacted with and around the robot in the activated urban space.

From the beginning of the project, the aim was to activate the not very populated laneway and connect people with the space and with each other. During the making, frequent on-site testing was necessary in order to tackle technical issues (e.g. making the robot move on the rough terrain of the laneway), but also to observe the urban situation (e.g. potential pedestrian flow). During the festival, Woodie gained growing popularity resulting in it becoming one of the event's main draw cards. Woodie attracted considerable promotion in social and traditional media, and consequently a significant number of visitors from the local community and visitors from other suburbs were coming to see Woodie despite it being tucked away in a quiet laneway.",,,,,"Woodie has been developed using a range of open-source software platforms and digital fabrication tools. To achieve the drawing behaviour, we built on and repurposed Grbl, which is a freely available and open-source gcodeparser. Grbl is mainly used in computer-aided manufacturing, for example to control 3D printers and laser cutters. For programming and controlling the low-res lighting display we used Processing and ArtNet DMX. Woodie's shell and its structural parts were custom-made and developed at our school's workshops following a process of iteration and testing. Tools and fabrication processes included: vacuum forming, 3D-scanning, laser-cutting and 3D-printing.",,,,,,,,,

They are mounted on a steel frame, which is attached to the sheet metal facade of the donut-shaped building. The solar modules facing outwards each have two embedded LED units, which are bi-directional in the sense that there is one LED pointing away from the facade and one pointing onto the facade. By combining power generation and light source, we created a zero-energy media facade. This means that the total amount of energy consumed by the facade over a year is (at least) equal to the amount of energy it produces itself.","Organic photovoltaics makes it possible to create media facades that meet both aesthetic and ecological requirements. Because they can be manufactured in a variety of shapes and sizes, are flexible, semi-transparent and extremely light sensitive, organic solar modules are ideal for a curved structure. They are also carbon-based, contain much less grey energy than silicon solar modules and are thus a good choice not only from a design point of view, but also from a sustainability perspective. At the Novartis Pavillon, the electricity generated by the organic solar cells is used to illuminate the building. The LEDs shine both outwards and in the direction of the metal shell beneath - causing their light to reflect and shimmer through the semi-transparent solar modules.","The total resolution of the facade is 240 x 126 px. Each LED forms one pixel and is controlled individually. Half of the LEDs face away from the building, half face towards the building.","The Novartis Pavillon is located in a park within the Novartis Campus in Basel, Switzerland. It is situated right next to the river Rhine and the bridge ""Dreirosenbrücke"". The zero-energy media facade acts as an interface between the inside and the outside, allowing the building to enter into a dialogue with the surrounding urban space. It turns the Novartis Pavillon into a luminous icon that is visible from many locations in Basel.","Every day after sunset, the facade shows the works of three international artists: Daniel Canogar, Esther Hunziker and Semiconductor. They collaborated with scientists to develop artworks inspired by the shapes and colours of cells and molecules, as well as the themes of sustainability and the convergence of art and science. During daytime, the facade displays moving text, using only the white LEDs that face away from the building.","Laurids Jensen, iart - studio for media architectures, Laurids Jensen, iart - studio for media architectures, Laurids Jensen, iart - studio for media architectures, iart - studio for media architectures, iart - studio for media architectures",iart - studio for media architectures,,,,,,,,,,iart - studio for media architectures / AMDL CIRCLE and Michele De Lucchi,iart - studio for media architectures,,iart - studio for media architectures,Pixel distance is approx. 56 cm.,"To keep both energy consumption and light pollution as low as possible, an algorithm was implemented to ensure that the facade is just bright enough for content to be visible.

The assembly is composed of custom metal fabrications with translucent polycarbonate and glass diffusing surfaces. Materials were selected for the quality in which they reflect, diffuse, or 'catch' light to allow the framework for the lighting to become essential to the experience of the observer. These materials include a reflective aluminum 'exoskeleton' on the public side made of notched and welded 9.5mm aluminum bar stock, an 8mm layer of tempered, laminated safety glass with a translucent interlayer for light diffusion, a 9.5mm thermoformed, translucent polycarbonate geometry, and a supporting galvanized steel subframe surface mounted to the concrete infrastructure of the underpass.","The responsive public art lighting installation is composed of a total of 216 Nano Linear Allegro AC XB RGB LED fixtures and 17,248 individually controlled DOT XL-3 RGB LED fixtures by Traxon Technologies, with half of all fixtures located on each side of the underpass within the protective and performative assembly of custom metal fabrications, polycarbonate and glass.

Though conceived as a mechanism to improve safety and connectivity for its daily commuters, the City's underpasses have ironically come to embody the most uncomfortable of Calgary's public spaces. A 2015 Centre City Perception survey identified Calgary's underpasses as having the lowest rating of all centre city infrastructure for cleanliness and citizen expectation.

Architecture can often seem overpowering and intimidating and this work moves gently and deliberately to counteract the dominant structural nature of many urban designs. ""Still Light brings a calming energy. It slows the pace and gently beckons people back into the CBD."" In line with Melbourne City Council street lighting guidelines, RAMUS was sensitive to creating an experience that felt gentle and impactful at human scale. Strobing and disruptive light patterns were excluded from the content sequence to ensure the faíçade did not cause disruption to residents in surrounding buildings.",Architectural Light Artwork,"Still Light consists of 1,136m of individually mapped LED fixtures and RAMUS' custom-built software platform called CORE. This bespoke control system operates each light fixture and integrates the content into a dynamic self-adjusting schedule that allows the building to respond to the different rhythms of the city. The work is mounted on the inner layer of the faíçade, with each light integrated into the frame of the glazing, creating a sense of the building itself being a light fixture. When that fixture turns on, the whole building starts to move, or so it seems.","As a building that operates 24 hours, RAMUS considered the change in rhythm that the Melbourne city has from day to day and morning to evening. These movements informed the timing of content, which is scheduled to be always-on. The outcome for the surrounding community is soothing, as each light movement reflects into the neighbouring laneways and onto architectural surfaces, creating a jewel-like effect across the footpaths and streets of the Paris end of Collins St.","Introducing Still Light, RAMUS' new media architecture installation that graces all 42-storeys of a new high-rise building.","Ramus, Ramus, Ramus",,,,,,,,,,,,Brookfield Multiplex,,,,,

Its surface is covered with ceramic louvers, which the architects developed especially for the museum. Two different types of LED are integrated into the ceramic louvers of the facade that faces Victoria Harbour. They form a hybrid display system that makes content visible under different lighting conditions and from different angles and distances. The LEDs are embedded into the facade in such a way that they are barely visible when switched off.","The M+ Facade consists of two different types of LEDs: focused high-power LEDs, which are best viewed from a distance, and diffuse low-power LEDs, whose visibility is best close up, from the museum's podium roof garden. The layers can be controlled independently to generate an illusion of depth. Thus, in the evening hours, the M+ Facade display can be seen from the surrounding art park, as well as from Hong Kong Island across the harbour.","The virtual resolution of the M+ Facade is 2816 x 1686 pixels. This is the format in which the content is created. It is then mapped onto the physical display, which consists of 118 horizontal LED rows integrated into the facade and thus has a resolution of 2816 x 118 pixels. The human eye automatically fills in the missing image content. Each row features 2100 low-power LEDs and 716 high-power LEDs. The high-power LEDs have a narrow beam angle and the low-power LEDs have a wide beam angle. They are 8bit RGB LEDs, so the colour depth is 24 bits.

M+ is located at the southernmost edge of the WKCD, in a prime position overlooking the harbour. The 'hybrid' design of the M+ Facade ensures that people can watch the nightly programme from the museum's roof garden, underneath the vertical tower of the M+ building. They can also enjoy it from the WKCD waterfront, as well as from the busy public piers in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, 2km away. The best uninterrupted view, however, is from across the harbour on Hong Kong Island, 1.5km away. Here, viewers can take in the M+ Facade from the waterfront promenade that stretches 5.5 km from Wan Chai to Sai Ying Pun. The M+ Facade is also a highlight for thousands of commuters who make the cross-harbour trip by ferry every night.","Video 1 features a diversity of artistic content that was displayed on the M+ Facade in 2022, including 'In Search of Vanished Blood' by Nalini Malani (00:06-00:20); 'The Shape of Light' by Ellen Pau (0:33-43 and 1:33-1:35), 'Touch for Luck' by Moniker (0:55-1:08), 'Free Radicals' by Len Lye (00:46-00:48), 'Morning After the Deluge' by Paul Pfeiffer (1:08-1:10), and excerpts from 15 different M+ Collection Highlight Videos. A full list of credits is included in the video. Video 2 contains instructions on how to play the four-hour game 'Touch for Luck'. As players progress through the game, they collect gems (lucky charms) that allow players to interact with other fish.

The initial phase of redevelopment, facing Sloane Square, was the first steel-framed, glass-fronted building in Britain and is particularly significant in the history of 20th century British architecture. The panels of the media faíçade are fitted between the glass spandrel panels and the building structure. Their dimensions are 965 x 1245 x 28 mm. To minimise the impact on the building, we used existing elements of the faíçade for the cable routing, so that only two perforations had to be made.","The panels are equipped with kinetic slats and a large RGBW backlight. Depending on the ambient lighting situation, a change in appearance is created by only the slats (day), an interplay between the slats and the backlight (dawn and dusk), and only the backlight (night).",There are 133 panels in total: three rows featuring 42 panels and a fourth row - facing Sloane Square - with 7 panels. Each of the panels is controlled individually. The RGBW backlights handle 60 frames per second of 16 bit RGBW data.,"The Peter Jones department store is located in London's Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, on Sloane Square. The media faíçade spans the curved corner of the building between Sloane Square and King's Road. It is a busy shopping area consisting of mainly C19th buildings that have shops on the lower floors and apartments above.","The content is generated by a real-time system whose parameters are influenced by inputs from a weather station on the roof. The so-called Lorenz model - named after the meteorologist Edward Lorenz - is the basis of the system. It serves to illustrate the air pressure and shows circular structures, which form repeating but never identical patterns. To guarantee frequent change, two Lorenz systems are superimposed. This creates a constantly changing visual rhythm. Movement, contrast and brightness of the faíçade vary. On a hot day with high air pressure, clearer patterns will be visible. On a rainy day, by contrast, the patterns will be more fluid in movement and softer in contrast. On a regular day, the content shown is based on an interplay of different shades of white and grey. This can be adapted for special occasions and seasonal themes.","Maris Mazulis, Maris Mazulis, Maris Mazulis, Maris Mazulis, Maris Mazulis, iart - studio for media architectures, Cultureshock Media, iart - studio for media architectures, Cultureshock Media",iart - studio for media architectures,,,,,,,,,,iart - studio for media architectures / Sergison Bates architects,iart - studio for media architectures,iart - studio for media architectures,,The pixel distance is approximately 1.3 metres horizontally and 4 metres vertically.,The faíçade was developed to cause as little light pollution as possible. During the day it emits no light at all and at night we use the slats to direct the light downwards towards the street. This keeps the light radiation towards the other buildings and the sky to a minimum. The luminance is <20nits with an angle of 45Â° towards the street (at night).,iart - studio for media architectures

The projection covers the whole areas of the facade, right to ground level. The building is part of a terrace of buildings which house small business (restaurants, army surplus, strip bars). Presumably a neighbouring building has been demolished at some point, leaving the rough brickwork of an interior in profile. The facade is rectangular on a roughly 2:1 ratio (20.5m x 10.25m). The lower right portion of the facade is rough grey stone. The parts of the facade have been painted white, whilst other parts remains red brick and grey stone. The facade is frequently subject to graffiti, which affects the behaviour of the optical feedback system by virtue of changing the colour and texture of the facade.","The primary source of light creation is projection, though in theory the system can work with other forms of 'screen'. Since the work is an optical feedback system, additional methods of light creation or manipulation (ambient lighting, car headlights, phone torches, lasers, shadows etc) will also affect the work. Écran de Veille (Sept 2022) sited at mí©tro St Laurent used a projection system managed by Quartier des Spectacles. The system used two (2) Christie Roadster S+16K projectors, in double convergence, with a 2.6-4.1:1 Zoom lens. The projectors display a 4:3 image in landscape mode.","Écran de Veille (Sept 2022) projection used a functional resolution of 1400 x 700 pixels. The resolution of the work can be adapted depending on the site. As the work is an optical feedback system. any changes in the final projected image, the camera input or the video signal will, by definition, affect the behaviour of the feedback, thereby inducing changes in the patterns generated. Similarly, changes in the mode of transmission from camera to projector (cable length, type, quality, capture card, processor speed) will affect the latency of the feedback loop, again, altering the behaviour.","Metro St Laurent (H2X 1J5) is near the heart of the lively downtown area of Montreal. The projection facade looks onto an open gravel square by a busy crossroads. It also accommodates bicycle parking racks. As such it is transient site for people moving through the city. Any works - which are projected right to ground level - receive a fair amount of acknowledgement and engagement. The building facade is not well maintained, though graffiti is periodically cleared. The square has several benches and planters enabling people to wait for friends whilst enjoying the projections. The area has many homeless people. Later in the evenings people pass through on their way to nightclubs, often drunk. Wooden hoardings run from the facade to the station entrance. It is not uncommon to see people urinate against the wooden hoardings or the projection facade itself.","The video showreel depicts the 20 minute loop of the installation on site - containing 5 x generative feedback scenes (3 mins each), and 5 x 'desktop documentaries' (1 minute each), as well as the commissioners credits.","Sam Meech, Sam Meech, Sam Meech, Sam Meech, Sam Meech, Sam Meech, Sam Meech, Sam Meech",Yolí¨ne Le Roux / Amí©lie Forget - Quartier des Spectacles,Quartier des Spectacles,,,,,,,,,,,,,approx 1.5cm (mí©tro St Laurent projection),stated luminance in the Quartier 16 000 lm however it could well be that these projectors have been in use for a long while.,

This can affect their access to social capital (friendships) which limits their access to opportunities such as recommendations for jobs, emotional support etc. As one step to encourage social interaction, Communify put a ''Happy to Chat' sign on a bench outside of their premises to encourage those accessing Communify's Wi-Fi to speak to one another: where serves as the inspiration for Chatty Bench Project.","1. People: The digital stories have the capability of building relationships amongst strangers. It happened in the online making of the stories during COVID-19 and it took place by those who experienced the stories in KGUV: they felt connected to the storytellers and most importantly, KGUV is ""a place of breathing and feeling people."" 2. Place: Anyone who plays the stories is taken to different parts of KGUV: they experience the place through the eyes of the storyteller, connect it to their own knowledge and memories of the place and create new memory-mashes in the process. The place, thus, has enhanced meaning. 3.

Can we use these lines as a starting point to fill the negative space between us with something positive? Naturally, we turned to music and dance. Walk Walk Dance was born.","Walk Walk Dance was designed to promote walking and encourage people to engage freely: some walk next to the lines, intrigued by the music; others step on them without stopping; most take a minute or two to explore the melodies; and some start to dance, channeling the missing street parties for a moment. The current sanitary crisis has proven how important it is for people who don't know each other to connect in order to make healthy cities. We see our work as a premise for interaction between strangers through joy. We believe in creating joyful public art. Joy allows us to connect more easily with our neighbours, building trust. Trust builds strong communities. And strong communities can do anything.","Walk Walk Dance is part of Daily tous les jours' ongoing research on the art of walking, where people reconnect with their body, their surroundings, and with each other.

However, evidence suggests that a substantial part of citizens do not take up this opportunity because they do not want to invest the time or effort or experience a lack of social or contextual grounding. With CDK we aim to overcome many of these limitations through voluntary and opportunistic in-situ forms of interaction via a broadly accepted medium that is approachable, safe and informal, yet still credible and trustworthy. Despite its apparent simplicity, CDK's unique quality is that it facilitates public surveying via responsive, graphical and narrative questions without depending on external energy infrastructure.

It resonates therapeutic and meditation spaces to foster human needs and fits with robotic arms's technical requirements and motion-range. Spatial modularity, via metal frames, tracks and moving curtains, allows multiple humans and robotic arms of varied scales to co-create.",,,"Project:Galath3a speculates on a near future when automatons and humans co-create and co-inhabit spaces. In an urban sense, this proposal relates to design trends of Industry 4.0: the move of small and medium scale industries back into the city. This includes clean fabrication tools, such as 3D printers and robotic arms, alongside a growing trend of robots for home-use. Work and work-tools reinstated at home raise questions about the changing notions of ""work"", ""tools'' and our relationship with it. These shifts alter the urban environment, merging once zoned land uses and public with private.","Filmed at the Berlin Open Lab (BOL), Universití¤t der Künste (UDK), Berlin, it features live footage of a designed tool-path painting a human face The robotic arm is mounted with a 3D printed end-effector, designed to hold a brush. Raising questions about sexuality, gender biases, and human-machine kinship, the initiative focuses on ""the act of applying makeup and hacks it because it is synonymous with the notion of ""perfection"", the commoditization of the woman-body and the male gaze"". In fact, it includes Hi-Res 3D facial scans and digital design of bespoke painting-patterns. The robot arm is taught how to carefully approach humans, and paint their faces. To build trust between people and machines, gestures are introduced into the machine-path; and with repetition, simulation, and gentle touch, trust is gained.","Project: Galath3a, Project: Galath3a, Project: Galath3a, Project: Galath3a, Project: Galath3a, Project: Galath3a, Project: Galath3a, Project: Galath3a",Project: Galath3a,"Berlin Open Lab, Universití¤t der Künste (UDK), Berlin",,,"Project:GALATH3A is concerned with the emerging need of addressing ethics in technology by analyzing and acknowledging gender and racial biases in existing data structures. We use human-robot interaction (HRI) and data analysis to build up and speculate on future post-human discourses. The project relates to women's image in the digital age and uses robotic fabrication, to speculate on what is culturally considered as ""womanly behavior"". Our aim is to improve communication and collaboration through trust and consent, in HRI and in human discourse. We propose an innovative approach: in a process we call Robotic Mirroring, human-gestures are studied, recorded and translated into machine tool-path. With the robot as mimic, Mirroring lets us ask questions about the nature of these behaviors: are they necessary? Should it be passed on? If so, how could we enhance it to empower women?","Our aim is to make our research endeavor public in multiple channels and address coded biases. To avoid gender, racial and other biases in data and design, multiple tests with varied participants are necessary. We aim to reach diverse populations by taking the research out of the lab and into the public sphere. To do so, we propose the design of a portable installation and mini-lab (""mobile art laboratory""= MALA), hosted in public events like fairs, festivals and conferences. This is advantageous also in exposing wider audiences to HRI and addressing human bias, against machines. By exposing the public to cutting edge-tech, we want to address stereotypes concerning facial recognition, robots and AI. We intend to create an equitable approach and move away from the ongoing discourse of biased information currently available and used by machine learning algorithms and AI.","Project:Galath3a's technological ambition is innovative in its use of numeric fabrication tools: promoting societal discourse and addressing future challenges of HRI, in gesture communication. This use of CAD-CAM is contrasted to widespread use of robotic arms: working a non-regular surface (skin and bones), responding to moving subjects and performing human-like, expressive motions. Originative use of 3D scans for tool-path planning is advantageous in Hi-Res execution. It allows a continuously updated dataflow. Our intended performance of the robotic arm on multiple users at once has, to the best of our knowledge, never been done before.","Project:Galath3a constitutes of a multitude of cutting-edge technology. Robotic fabrication with UR5 robotic-arm, path-planning in Rhinoceros 3D, Grasshopper 3D and Robots plugin for GH; photogrammetric 3D scans, mesh analysis with 3D Zephyr, digital makeup patterns in Rhino-GH; 3D printed robot end-effectors for makeup tools (FDM; SLS), graphic and video editing in Adobe/ Affinity creative suite. The work is simulated and tested on our faces.","To test our design proposal in HRI, public-participatory interactive installations(""mobile art laboratories"") are proposed to observe human reactions, live. Currently, robotic fabrication is programmed to fit with the features of the researchers. To increase our scope and execute multiple bespoke designs and fabrications for every new participant, we are looking to improve the data transfer between tangible to digital. We wish to include real-time scanning and work with a 3d scanner mounted on the robotic arm. Live data stream would increase the speed of the process while enhancing the participatory nature of the experience. Later, we wish to use live-scanning to further inform robotic gestures. Then we aim for two-way communication, in movement: responding to inputs of facial expressions and bio-data. This will culminate with a language of gestures, responding to participants' signals.","Project:GALATH3A is an ongoing design research in woman-machine collaboration, performed at the Berlin Open Lab, Universití¤t der Künste (UDK), Berlin.",,,,,,,

Over three months in 2021, a streetscape was developed with local architecture students collecting footage of the city's neighborhoods using a GoPro camera. After that, Senseable City Lab researchers processed the visuals with the help of AI. The materials were fed to a pre-trained object detection model and then a deep learning-based semantic segmentation model, so that different subjects (buildings, people, cars, trees etc.) and activities (walking, skateboarding etc.) are identified with colored masks. Ultimately, such extensive analyses of the built environment and human dynamics reveal the locations most apt to launch CRA's Urban Vision. Moreover, the harvested data is set to be shared on an open-source basis to advance bottom-up urbanism processes.",,,"Having experienced a tumultuous century, Kosovo's public space had almost always taken a backseat. The scarce infrastructural heritage left behind by the Ottoman Empire, including the bazaar, was destroyed by Tito after the Second World War. His regime built spacious squares, but not a free civil society to inhabit them. Then came the war, national independence, and an unruly real estate expansion so chaotic that some scholars ominously called it ""Turbo Urbanism"". As a result, cafes and restaurants abound in today's Prishtina, but parks are rare and often without benches. Cars rule the squares and the few other remaining common areas. In response, we built on the discourse of ""the battle for public space"" put forward by former mayor Shpend Ahmeti, and sought to transform the traditionally rigid process of urban creation into one that is open and evolutionary.",,"Atdhe Mulla, Ivan Erofeev, MIT Senseable City Lab, Atdhe Mulla, MIT Senseable City Lab, Atdhe Mulla, Ivan Erofeev, CRA-Carlo Ratti Associati",,,"As a project to realize CRA's Urban Vision, Commons Sense thrived in Prishtina because it managed to engage the local communities in various capacities. First, the architecture students at the University of Prishtina took part in the process to scan the streets. With GoPro cameras on hand or on the helmet while riding a bike, they not only contributed invaluable urban data to the initiative, but also got to experience the city in a new way. Later on, they also helped set up the urban interventions by demarcating the activity spaces with yellow paint. When the interventions were opened, all the local residents had the chance to ""vote with their feet"". By choosing whether and how to interact with the temporary structures, they become a key cog in the feedback loop, providing useful indicators of the designs' potential to improve the public space, and implicitly deciding their destiny.",,"Commons Sense tackled the longstanding problem in Prishtina where citizens are alienated from the public space. A lack of planning in development is a root cause of the issue. To counter this, CRA's Urban Vision made a targeted effort by introducing an informed approach led by data and local citizens, which ensured that the ultimate results actually contribute to the long-term growth of the city. On a micro level, the initiative proposed solutions for various issues widespread in Prishtina, from eradicating illegal parking to reactivating abandoned buildings.","Some of the interventions executed by CRA in 2021 have been integrated into the city's social fabric. For instance, the former Hivzi Sulejmani Library, whose external gates had been reclaimed from illegal parking for recreational use, was turned into a permanent cultural institution, the Centre for Narrative Practice. The former Brick Factory, first converted into an ""urban living room"", was transformed by the Biennal and German practice Raumlabor into a temporary Eco Urban Learning Center. Working with Kosovo's Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport, CRA also helped pedestrianize a vibrant alley that is known to locals as Kafet e Rakis (Rakia's cafes).
