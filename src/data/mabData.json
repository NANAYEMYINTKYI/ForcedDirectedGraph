The resulting wooden-like tonality can be intuitively interpreted as a materiality that is generated 'out of' the architecture itself.",
    "Kind of light creation": "The wooden window frames are re-interpreted as architectural 'instruments' that can be more authentically actuated, such as by the mechanical hammering motion of a small piston, electronically driven by a solenoid. The overall sound landscape consists of unique and ever-changing combinations of wooden sounds with different tones and rhythms.",
    "Resolution and transmitting behaviour": "By trial-and-error the passers-by are invited to 'discover' the functionality of the faíçade. When the basic functionality is understood passers-by can control the actuation of the faíçade and 'play'. When people are approaching each other, social interaction is anticipated. If they disperse and stop or don't socially interact, the soundscape will gradually vanish.",
    "Urban situation": "The architecture office is situated between the busy beltway of Leuven and the more quiet and peaceful Ruelenspark. A gradually changing urban soundscape characterizes the public passage along the DMOA office. Inspired by this contextual quality, sound was used as a 'medium' for the media faíçade, which would respect the subtle stamped concrete, yet be perceivable enough to facilitate interactions.",
    "Description of showreel": "The content of the media faíçade, or what message it conveys relates to how the building itself communicates with its immediate environment. The responsive character allows the building to manifest itself in the socio-cultural fabric by stimulating social interaction with and between local residents, and by implying and accentuating the curved 'pull' movement of the front facade towards the park.",

The installation gives people magical powers to create situations that are normally reserved for fantasy. The 'Magic Dust' allows you to throw and push luminescent particles through the faíçade with glittering sound effects. While with 'Rain', you can part the shower of light like with an umbrella. 'Sand' is in an organic manipulation of the faíçade, where shadow and form drift as dunes, followed by the sounds of the wind and shifting sands. 'Stars' provide the remarkable opportunity to dream up your own constellations in the middle of a bright city, each star appearing with an accoustic chime. 'Aurora' provides the opportunity to touch ephemeral strands of plasma, the supernatural becomes tangible together with harmonic resonances. 'Fireworks' provides the opportunity to initiate spontaneous bursts of sparkles and colour, whistling rockets rush upwards in the background with explosions in the foreground. 'Ripple' is a melody of piano notes that generates psychedelic oil drops which collide and mix into new compositions. 'Light Orchestra' transforms the building into a musical instrument of violins and cellos, allowing the public to compose their own symphony.",

In result, during daytime the faíçade with red and white details blends into the surroundings of the urban community. When the night falls, the lighting system embedded behind the joints of aluminum curtain walls dynamically illuminates the whole building. The aluminum panels that wrap around the Rubik's Cubes are of two different unit sizes, 1.3 meters wide square and 2.7 meters wide square. Meanwhile, the interactive media faíçade measuring around 2000 square meter QR codes or other visual content turns the community shopping center into a physical interface between people's iPhone screens and retail experience.",
    "Kind of light creation": "UNIFUN's corner multi-media faíçades consist of LED pixel modules connecting end to end with white textured glass on the exterior instead of the whole high resolution LED signage, mainly due to the restriction by city's urban planning regulations. The white and red lighting faíçades that complements the media cubes consist of matte LED strip lights embedded in the aluminum curtain walls, and the system adopted the DMX512 segment control technology. The entire faíçade can be easily edited and programmed to enrich the night cityscape daily.",
    "Resolution and transmitting behaviour": "The lighting transmitting behavior of UNIFUN's media faíçade relies on the matrix of LED pixel modules. The number of modules embedded inside is 133 times 960, which equals 127,680. The design restriction on LED screen usage may not be as conducive to display high resolution content as possible, on the other hand, the entire faíçade favors the aesthetic of QR codes, 8 bit video games and retro style of graphic, which echoes better with the geometric lines of the architecture form.",
    "Urban situation": "UNIFUN is located in Tianfu zone of Chengdu, the rapidly developed southwest China city. The district is currently expanding as the technology and scientific zone, as it's connected to a new central business district by means of an ecological corridor. In the newly-developed vertical communities, where adequate facilities and public spaces are often lacking, community retail center has the potential to become a convenient meeting place. The multi-media faíçades coordinating with the large area of outdoor terraces by staggered cubes set-back appeal to public interactions both online and offline.",

The Sonic Runway's initial three-month installation in 2017 in front of City Hall was a huge success, bringing foot traffic to a previously avoided location, enhancing the sense of community and revitalizing the area. The impact of the Sonic Runway on the citizens of San Jose was so overwhelmingly positive, the city commissioned an updated Sonic Runway (building is underway) to be semi-permanently installed in the same location, once pandemic restrictions are lifted.",

Most often, there is no immediate benefit for citizens of collecting data. It's after data is processed, that it informs an action that affects citizens. Concerns about a sensor are often connected to concerns about potential action, and that the action has negative implications. Simple Sensors adresses this by: 1. Clear affordances that indicate what is measured 2. Real-time insight in how measurements are converted into data. 3. Show who is using data and for what purposes. 4. Indicate the intervals with which data is shared 5. Clear presence in public space as interface to city management 6. Invite people to verify if the sensor is working as intended. 7. Have playful features that invite citizens to engage with the sensor.",

    "Kind of light creation": "The lighting aesthetics of the installation is achieved through two active lighting components: (1) Six high-power ultraviolet (UV) lamps were installed around the drawing area. In combination with the luminescent chalk drawings, the laneway was turned into a magical space of glowing words and illustrations. A particular feature also emerged through the characteristic aesthetics of the robot's drawings in comparison to those made by people. (2) A low-resolution lighting display was integrated into the outer shell of the robot. The display is inspired by the aesthetics of low-resolution urban media facades.",
    "Resolution and transmitting behaviour": "The low-res lighting display is composed of 16 pixels in width and 4 pixels in height. The display is integrated into the robot's outer shell, completely encircling the spherical shape. The size of the pixels at the bottom row are approx. 100mm x 40mm, with pixels becoming more narrow and higher towards the top. To make each pixel cell distinguishable from another we designed a laser-cut waffle structure. For a homogeneous diffusion within each pixel cell, we added a white reflector sheet behind each LED, and a diffused sheet at the front of each cell. To maximise the diffusion and create a nice finish, we sandblasted the custom-made vacuum formed shell. Emissions of the surrounding UV lights increase the perceived contrast of the low-res display. The RGB LED system (as well as all other hardware components of the robot) are powered by a 12 voltage / 12Ah Lithium rechargeable battery.",
    "Urban situation": "Woodie was deployed for 17 evenings in a usually quiet laneway situated within Chatswood which is a major business and residential district of Sydney. The laneway connects a cultural centre and two large shopping malls. During the day, the lane is mainly used for the delivery of products to a nearby warehouse, however, during the time of the festival the lane was pedestrianised and closed for traffic. The designated area in which Woodie was drawing on the ground was roughly 15 metres in length and 5 metres in width. Despite the complexity of integrating urban robots into public spaces, we achieved that Woodie had not to be fenced off which allowed people to come close to it and even touch it.

    "Community or communities involved": "Woodie has been developed in close consultation with the Willoughby City Council who was responsible for hosting the festival in Sydney Chatswood. From the beginning of the project, the aim was to activate the not very populated laneway and connect people with the space and with each other. During the making, frequent on-site testing was necessary in order to tackle technical issues (e.g. making the robot move on the rough terrain of the laneway), but also to observe the urban situation (e.g. potential pedestrian flow). During the festival, Woodie gained growing popularity resulting in it becoming one of the event's main draw cards. Woodie attracted considerable promotion in social and traditional media, and consequently a significant number of visitors from the local community and visitors from other suburbs were coming to see Woodie despite it being tucked away in a quiet laneway.",

    "Tools used": "Woodie has been developed using a range of open-source software platforms and digital fabrication tools. To achieve the drawing behaviour, we built on and repurposed Grbl, which is a freely available and open-source gcodeparser. Grbl is mainly used in computer-aided manufacturing, for example to control 3D printers and laser cutters. For programming and controlling the low-res lighting display we used Processing and ArtNet DMX. Woodie's shell and its structural parts were custom-made and developed at our school's workshops following a process of iteration and testing. Tools and fabrication processes included: vacuum forming, 3D-scanning, laser-cutting and 3D-printing.",

The closure of cultural centers, the absence of nightlife and the intense urban media activist projections, culminated in spontaneous and guerrilla urban media interventions, the SP_Urban Arte Conecta emerged in this context. Until the quarantine, windows were mere membranes of private space with public space. After a few weeks of confinement the windows became spaces of protest, of performance, space of community socialisation like an affective interface.",

They are mounted on a steel frame, which is attached to the sheet metal facade of the donut-shaped building. The solar modules facing outwards each have two embedded LED units, which are bi-directional in the sense that there is one LED pointing away from the facade and one pointing onto the facade. By combining power generation and light source, we created a zero-energy media facade. This means that the total amount of energy consumed by the facade over a year is (at least) equal to the amount of energy it produces itself.",
    "Kind of light creation": "Organic photovoltaics makes it possible to create media facades that meet both aesthetic and ecological requirements. Because they can be manufactured in a variety of shapes and sizes, are flexible, semi-transparent and extremely light sensitive, organic solar modules are ideal for a curved structure. They are also carbon-based, contain much less grey energy than silicon solar modules and are thus a good choice not only from a design point of view, but also from a sustainability perspective. At the Novartis Pavillon, the electricity generated by the organic solar cells is used to illuminate the building. The LEDs shine both outwards and in the direction of the metal shell beneath - causing their light to reflect and shimmer through the semi-transparent solar modules.",
    "Resolution and transmitting behaviour": "The total resolution of the facade is 240 x 126 px. Each LED forms one pixel and is controlled individually. Half of the LEDs face away from the building, half face towards the building.",
    "Urban situation": "\"The Novartis Pavillon is located in a park within the Novartis Campus in Basel",
    "Description of showreel": "Switzerland. It is situated right next to the river Rhine and the bridge \"\"Dreirosenbrücke\"\". The zero-energy media facade acts as an interface between the inside and the outside",
    "Mediacredits": "allowing the building to enter into a dialogue with the surrounding urban space. It turns the Novartis Pavillon into a luminous icon that is visible from many locations in Basel.\"",
    "Project co-ordination": "Every day after sunset, the facade shows the works of three international artists: Daniel Canogar, Esther Hunziker and Semiconductor. They collaborated with scientists to develop artworks inspired by the shapes and colours of cells and molecules, as well as the themes of sustainability and the convergence of art and science. During daytime, the facade displays moving text, using only the white LEDs that face away from the building.",

The project develops and shifts over time according to the needs of the inhabitants and the community at large. The North and South facades would be developed differently according to the level of sunlight. The North Facade would use more transparent materials and would leave space between the windows and the platforms to allow for sunlight whereas the South facing facade - which receives more direct light - wouldn't require this.",

The project also has a major effect on the street - allowing for additional dining, commercial and circulation space. The level of community is brought up to the levels we live on.",
    "Description of showreel": "This pandemic will end. We will adapt the way we communicate, connect and circulate once again. But, the need for a solidified new network of connection will still be necessary. We must rethink our use of the ground - shouldn't we allow retail, dining and public activities to take over our the street level? What if we created a new network of social traffic above the street level - connecting friends, families and activities. This physical, very tactile connection combats the virtual space we find ourselves in today. Can we formalize the informal social networks we create?",

Materials were selected for the quality in which they reflect, diffuse, or 'catch' light to allow the framework for the lighting to become essential to the experience of the observer. These materials include a reflective aluminum 'exoskeleton' on the public side made of notched and welded 9.5mm aluminum bar stock, an 8mm layer of tempered, laminated safety glass with a translucent interlayer for light diffusion, a 9.5mm thermoformed, translucent polycarbonate geometry, and a supporting galvanized steel subframe surface mounted to the concrete infrastructure of the underpass.",

The public art lighting experience is created with a custom detection technology software developed by INVIVIA. This custom software receives video content of pedestrian movement via 4 on-site cameras, analyzes and filters this content, and translates it into the abstracted, colourful representation experienced by visitors to the site.",

Though conceived as a mechanism to improve safety and connectivity for its daily commuters, the City's underpasses have ironically come to embody the most uncomfortable of Calgary's public spaces. A 2015 Centre City Perception survey identified Calgary's underpasses as having the lowest rating of all centre city infrastructure for cleanliness and citizen expectation. In 2010, the 2-block stretch of the 4th St SW underpass was identified by The City as a priority for improvement and launched the project in January 2015. Around this time, the underpass was used by approximately 8,100 people daily, accounting for nearly 20% of all pedestrian traffic to the core.",

Working closely with the Design Team, interested individuals were offered four critical opportunities to participate in the creative process: identifying issues, finding collective solutions and influencing the project as a process and a product. A full-scale mock-up was completed towards the end of the Design Development phase to demonstrate proof of concept, facilitate owner and stakeholder buy-in, and provide a tool for design research for the future development of the detailed drawings for construction.",

This bespoke control system operates each light fixture and integrates the content into a dynamic self-adjusting schedule that allows the building to respond to the different rhythms of the city. The work is mounted on the inner layer of the faíçade, with each light integrated into the frame of the glazing, creating a sense of the building itself being a light fixture. When that fixture turns on, the whole building starts to move, or so it seems.",
    "Project co-ordination": "As a building that operates 24 hours, RAMUS considered the change in rhythm that the Melbourne city has from day to day and morning to evening. These movements informed the timing of content, which is scheduled to be always-on. The outcome for the surrounding community is soothing, as each light movement reflects into the neighbouring laneways and onto architectural surfaces, creating a jewel-like effect across the footpaths and streets of the Paris end of Collins St.",

They form a hybrid display system that makes content visible under different lighting conditions and from different angles and distances. The LEDs are embedded into the facade in such a way that they are barely visible when switched off.",
    "Kind of light creation": "The M+ Facade consists of two different types of LEDs: focused high-power LEDs, which are best viewed from a distance, and diffuse low-power LEDs, whose visibility is best close up, from the museum's podium roof garden. The layers can be controlled independently to generate an illusion of depth. Thus, in the evening hours, the M+ Facade display can be seen from the surrounding art park, as well as from Hong Kong Island across the harbour.",

The human eye automatically fills in the missing image content. Each row features 2100 low-power LEDs and 716 high-power LEDs. The high-power LEDs have a narrow beam angle and the low-power LEDs have a wide beam angle. They are 8bit RGB LEDs, so the colour depth is 24 bits. Content is displayed at 30 fps.",

M+ is located at the southernmost edge of the WKCD, in a prime position overlooking the harbour. The 'hybrid' design of the M+ Facade ensures that people can watch the nightly programme from the museum's roof garden, underneath the vertical tower of the M+ building. They can also enjoy it from the WKCD waterfront, as well as from the busy public piers in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, 2km away. The best uninterrupted view, however, is from across the harbour on Hong Kong Island, 1.5km away. Here, viewers can take in the M+ Facade from the waterfront promenade that stretches 5.5 km from Wan Chai to Sai Ying Pun.

The initial phase of redevelopment, facing Sloane Square, was the first steel-framed, glass-fronted building in Britain and is particularly significant in the history of 20th century British architecture. The panels of the media faíçade are fitted between the glass spandrel panels and the building structure. Their dimensions are 965 x 1245 x 28 mm. To minimise the impact on the building, we used existing elements of the faíçade for the cable routing, so that only two perforations had to be made.",
    "Kind of light creation": "The panels are equipped with kinetic slats and a large RGBW backlight. Depending on the ambient lighting situation, a change in appearance is created by only the slats (day), an interplay between the slats and the backlight (dawn and dusk), and only the backlight (night).",
    "Resolution and transmitting behaviour": "There are 133 panels in total: three rows featuring 42 panels and a fourth row - facing Sloane Square - with 7 panels. Each of the panels is controlled individually. The RGBW backlights handle 60 frames per second of 16 bit RGBW data.",
    "Urban situation": "The Peter Jones department store is located in London's Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, on Sloane Square. The media faíçade spans the curved corner of the building between Sloane Square and King's Road. It is a busy shopping area consisting of mainly C19th buildings that have shops on the lower floors and apartments above.",
    "Description of showreel": "The content is generated by a real-time system whose parameters are influenced by inputs from a weather station on the roof. The so-called Lorenz model - named after the meteorologist Edward Lorenz - is the basis of the system. It serves to illustrate the air pressure and shows circular structures, which form repeating but never identical patterns. To guarantee frequent change, two Lorenz systems are superimposed. This creates a constantly changing visual rhythm. Movement, contrast and brightness of the faíçade vary. On a hot day with high air pressure, clearer patterns will be visible. On a rainy day, by contrast, the patterns will be more fluid in movement and softer in contrast. On a regular day, the content shown is based on an interplay of different shades of white and grey. This can be adapted for special occasions and seasonal themes.",

The projection covers the whole areas of the facade, right to ground level. The building is part of a terrace of buildings which house small business (restaurants, army surplus, strip bars). Presumably a neighbouring building has been demolished at some point, leaving the rough brickwork of an interior in profile. The facade is rectangular on a roughly 2:1 ratio (20.5m x 10.25m). The lower right portion of the facade is rough grey stone. The parts of the facade have been painted white, whilst other parts remains red brick and grey stone. The facade is frequently subject to graffiti, which affects the behaviour of the optical feedback system by virtue of changing the colour and texture of the facade.",
    "Kind of light creation": "The primary source of light creation is projection, though in theory the system can work with other forms of 'screen'. Since the work is an optical feedback system, additional methods of light creation or manipulation (ambient lighting, car headlights, phone torches, lasers, shadows etc) will also affect the work. Écran de Veille (Sept 2022) sited at mí©tro St Laurent used a projection system managed by Quartier des Spectacles. The system used two (2) Christie Roadster S+16K projectors, in double convergence, with a 2.6-4.1:1 Zoom lens. The projectors display a 4:3 image in landscape mode.",
    "Resolution and transmitting behaviour": "Écran de Veille (Sept 2022) projection used a functional resolution of 1400 x 700 pixels. The resolution of the work can be adapted depending on the site. As the work is an optical feedback system. any changes in the final projected image, the camera input or the video signal will, by definition, affect the behaviour of the feedback, thereby inducing changes in the patterns generated. Similarly, changes in the mode of transmission from camera to projector (cable length, type, quality, capture card, processor speed) will affect the latency of the feedback loop, again, altering the behaviour.",
    "Urban situation": "Metro St Laurent (H2X 1J5) is near the heart of the lively downtown area of Montreal. The projection facade looks onto an open gravel square by a busy crossroads. It also accommodates bicycle parking racks. As such it is transient site for people moving through the city. Any works - which are projected right to ground level - receive a fair amount of acknowledgement and engagement. The building facade is not well maintained, though graffiti is periodically cleared. The square has several benches and planters enabling people to wait for friends whilst enjoying the projections. The area has many homeless people. Later in the evenings people pass through on their way to nightclubs, often drunk. Wooden hoardings run from the facade to the station entrance. It is not uncommon to see people urinate against the wooden hoardings or the projection facade itself.",

It shows how much energy it harvested, how much energy it can still use, how long it will stay on based on the weather conditions of a given day. Sunscriber literally scribes the sun, records and screens its daily activities reaching Graz landscape on the BIX Facade while it harvests the the energy to do such inscription from the same source. It's a simple, close-circuited system that unpacks a mundane -but vital- cosmological event, i.e. sunbeams reaching surface of the Earth.",

    "Kind of light creation": "The ETFE is both lit from within and by reflecting colored flood lights transmitted through a mirror pool at the pavilion's base, giving the pavilion a dynamic, color-changing faíçade. Strip lighting at upper roof surfaces glows at night, highlighting the architecture's elegant curves and sinuous geometry. The illuminated ARC is also reflected onto its surroundings by the mirror pool at its base.",
    "Resolution and transmitting behaviour": "Interior plinth skylights, strip lighting along floor-plate edges, strip lighting along the spiraling circulation, and animated light from the projectors reflected from the projection screens provide an ambient atmosphere with calm, medium-to-low-level lighting optimized for viewing projection as well as specific task lighting for viewing non-projected, physical exhibition pieces.",

Second, reflection and refraction of the glass bricks give the screens a magical, mesmerising, pseudo-holographic effect when viewed from different angles.

Melbourne Connect is built on the site of the former Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne. The site carries enormous local significance as many Melburnians have connections to the site through family and friends' births. The site also fulfilled an instrumental role in enabling medical innovation as part of the University of Melbourne's research in medicine and health sciences since the early 1900s. The newly developed innovation precinct provides office space to academics in various faculties and schools, with the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology being the primary tenant.",

The content brings to life photographs of several thousand artefacts from the University's cultural collections of Indigenous significance and reflecting scientific innovation in the fields of engineering, medicine and biological sciences.

This can affect their access to social capital (friendships) which limits their access to opportunities such as recommendations for jobs, emotional support etc. As one step to encourage social interaction, Communify put a ''Happy to Chat' sign on a bench outside of their premises to encourage those accessing Communify's Wi-Fi to speak to one another: where serves as the inspiration for Chatty Bench Project.",

Simultaneously, such novel technologies can impact society quite broadly.

The shutter of the second camera follows the same time schedule but has a large push button. When passengers press this button, the shutter covers the camera for 15 minutes, like an opt out. The third camera is equipped with a shutter connected to a winding mechanism.

At this time Melbourne residents were subject to one of the longest home lockdowns in the world. People's movements were tightly restricted with curfews in place. Public buildings were closed. People's access to art and their access to each other was massively restricted. During these many months of continuous lockdown, people turned to digital architecture to find connection.

Inhibition targets to enrich the discourse of VR integration in theatrical performances by nonprofessional participants.

Also, we use three Arduino MKR1000 boards, a GSR sensor, a push, and three heartbeat sensors. Biofeedback is the key element of our idea that places the project also in the discourse of human perception, embodied cognitive theories, and the affordances of immersive technologies.",

Up until now, our experiments were focusing on audio-visual outputs and interactions between the virtual and physical space with only three participants. Our goal is to create bodily-engaging feedback loops between multiple participants, implement further inputs (such as body movements, gestures, or kinaesthetic patterns), enrich the visual aesthetics, and consolidate a gradient of interactions. In long-term goals, we aspire to establish our own practice and continue our research, by finding support through networks that promote new ideas and methods for live performances.",

    "Facade type and geometry (structure)": "Modular and independent of a fixed support structure. Custom 3D printed attachments enable the interface to be attached to a myriad of urban infrastructure elements.",
    "Kind of light creation": "CDK devices produce no light thanks to their e-paper displays, making the content readable in direct sunlight and diminishing attention at night when risk of vandalism is typically increased.",
    "Resolution and transmitting behaviour": "CDK devices have had various resolutions. The current version has 1200 by 825 pixel resolution display, previous iterations have featured lower resolutions (e.g. 800 by 480px). Current CDK displays have a ~1 second refresh speed that only occurs upon interaction in order to save energy.",
    "Urban situation": "CDK devices have been deployed in rural areas (attached to bus stops or bike racks at parking lots), in suburban municipalities (attached to fences and trees), as well as major metropolitan cities (attached to light poles, or on custom fabricated frameworks).",
    "Description of showreel": "The attached video depicts the key features of CDK: 1) its plug-and-play easy installation thanks to wireless networking and integrated batteries, enabling a tight connection between the content and location and distinct installation constellations features one or multiple screens; 2) its walk-up-and-use usability enabling a wide range of people to become engaged in civic topics centered in that location; 3) its branched polling narratives that transform answering questions into a playful storytelling experience; and 4) resulting in rich data sets that inform public policy and spark conversation in the community.",

    "Community or communities involved": "Citizen engagement aims to integrate bottom-up values and preferences into decision-making to increase the quality of decisions, inform citizens, foster trust and reduce conflict. However, evidence suggests that a substantial part of citizens do not take up this opportunity because they do not want to invest the time or effort or experience a lack of social or contextual grounding. With CDK we aim to overcome many of these limitations through voluntary and opportunistic in-situ forms of interaction via a broadly accepted medium that is approachable, safe and informal, yet still credible and trustworthy. Despite its apparent simplicity, CDK's unique quality is that it facilitates public surveying via responsive, graphical and narrative questions without depending on external energy infrastructure. It can show any information and gather multiple-choice opinions, at any time and place.",
    "Legal form": "CDK was used by citizen collectives, NGO's, municipalities, cities, an SME, European and local projects.",
    "Issues addressed": "With CDK the following civic issues were addressed: - Air pollution through citizen science air quality measurements in different neighborhoods in the city of Antwerp and a Civic Lab in Leuven (leuvenair.be). - Unlocking debate regarding heritage during a conference in Amsterdam, co-organized by H2020 project CLIC (The Netherlands, clicproject.eu). - Revealing housing and liveability concerns of municipalities, urban planning offices and NGO's in Leuven, Heist-op-den-Berg and Antwerp. - Urban design of sustainable mobility hubs in neighborhoods of Genk, Peer and Houthalen-Helchteren.",
    "Impact": "- CDK results were able to change strong preconceptions of the organizations that deployed them by revealing sentiments such as that more attention should be spent on the safety of cyclists and pedestrians. - Other results have confirmed prior understandings, such as how participants approved recent mobility changes. - Similarly, CDK results have provided evidence for previous knowledge, such as the local desire for a city forest, and unveiled new insights, including a need for more safety around specific areas. - Insights resulting from CDK have been combined with qualitative findings from face-to-face workshops to derive concrete design requirements for local mobility. - Other polling results have been distributed internally within municipalities to act as empirical evidence during policy debates.",
    "Tools developed": "The current CDK version is a variation on the previously open-sourced version available on GitHub (https://github.com/citizendialogkitproject/citizen-dialog-kit).",
    "Tools used": "",
    "Next steps": "Future steps include to study their ability to dynamically adapt questions based on previous answers, sensed or external data sources in a responsive way and further contextually situating the devices to produce even richer insights.",

After that, Senseable City Lab researchers processed the visuals with the help of AI. The materials were fed to a pre-trained object detection model and then a deep learning-based semantic segmentation model, so that different subjects (buildings, people, cars, trees etc.) and activities (walking, skateboarding etc.) are identified with colored masks. Ultimately, such extensive analyses of the built environment and human dynamics reveal the locations most apt to launch CRA's Urban Vision. Moreover, the harvested data is set to be shared on an open-source basis to advance bottom-up urbanism processes.",
