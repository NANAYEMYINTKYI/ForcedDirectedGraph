The intended dynamic media had to be invisible and unobtrusive, yet still be related to the architectural manifestation. The resulting wooden-like tonality can be intuitively interpreted as a materiality that is generated 'out of' the architecture itself.",
    "Kind of light creation": "The wooden window frames are re-interpreted as architectural 'instruments' that can be more authentically actuated, such as by the mechanical hammering motion of a small piston, electronically driven by a solenoid. The overall sound landscape consists of unique and ever-changing combinations of wooden sounds with different tones and rhythms.",
    "Resolution and transmitting behaviour": "By trial-and-error the passers-by are invited to 'discover' the functionality of the faíçade. When the basic functionality is understood passers-by can control the actuation of the faíçade and 'play'. When people are approaching each other, social interaction is anticipated. If they disperse and stop or don't socially interact, the soundscape will gradually vanish.",
    "Urban situation": "The architecture office is situated between the busy beltway of Leuven and the more quiet and peaceful Ruelenspark. A gradually changing urban soundscape characterizes the public passage along the DMOA office. Inspired by this contextual quality, sound was used as a 'medium' for the media faíçade, which would respect the subtle stamped concrete, yet be perceivable enough to facilitate interactions.",
    "Description of showreel": "The content of the media faíçade, or what message it conveys relates to how the building itself communicates with its immediate environment. The responsive character allows the building to manifest itself in the socio-cultural fabric by stimulating social interaction with and between local residents, and by implying and accentuating the curved 'pull' movement of the front facade towards the park.",

We associated the structure of the facade with the neural connections, which we brought to life as moving light neural impulses. To fix the light sources, a special curvilinear profile was developed that bends in both horizontal and vertical planes. This solution is completely integrated into the architecture of our building. On the facade of the shopping part of the complex, there are windows of irregular shapes for which we develop special louvered screens. These screens will be translucent, but from a certain distance, the video content will be visible on them.",

    "Description": "Interactive Media Structure \"\"The Pulse of Life\"\" was created for the Paris Design Week in Paris (2017) in collaboration with the Architectural Bureau \"\"Decor Kuznetsov\"\". The spatial interactive media sculpture was created to resemble the image of a human's heart. Recyclables used as a material were wastes from the footwear production. We combined different principles of lighting: an internal light from colored multi-channel lamps under different angles, a controllable outer light, and a 3d-mapping projection. Using 3d-mapping and internal lamps the sculpture became a stencil for interesting shadows. All the installation was tied to a single media server and accompanied by the audio content, which recreated the heartbeat on the background of meditative music. In addition, the sculpture was interactive. Kinetic sensors, which reacted to human movement, were placed around it.",

More than 30 variations of projections change themselves by special timings in consistency with common scenes of lighting. The backlight of the bar counter and the construction of scene and corridor are also dynamic and diverse. All of the lighting devices are controlled by a single specially designed system.",

    "Kind of light creation": "The lighting is a subtle & integral part of the visual nighttime experience. Bringing the audience to the ideas of time, timetables, journies. Working in a clockwise rotation the lighting design slowly brings up each route (one at a time) to its full light - holds for 5 minutes & then cross transitions to the next route, thus creating a 30min full rotation clock.",
    "Resolution and transmitting behaviour": "Starting from dusk, each route of the artwork is lit up for a 5 minute period then crossfaded to the next in a clockwise fashion. The lux levels are in keeping with the broader lighting design to be visually present but not overtly impactful. The idea is for cafe/bar patrons to use the work to keep a sense of time, in combination with catching transport at the stations.",

To light up the space, ClearLED was challenged with designing custom screens to fit the space precisely and deliver the maximum transparency and brightness.

Ramus undertook a culturally considered approach, the curatorial process for content created by cultural and social community groups began by engaging with community representational organizations. Ramus felt it was imperative to meaningfully and responsibly engage with diverse communities to generate and curate content that expressed the vision and voices of the people connected to the area. Ramus also engaged SAE Creative Media Institute students to create content in an ongoing commitment to not just serve, but also involve the community in the evolution of Yagan Square. Students had the opportunity to team up with Ramus Illumination to create content for the new digital tower, giving students a unique highly visible platform to showcase their works. 'The River Project' saw film and animation students creating short works highlighting the Swan River and it's presence in the City of Perth.",
