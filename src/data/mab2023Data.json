We associated the structure of the facade with the neural connections, which we brought to life as moving light neural impulses. To fix the light sources, a special curvilinear profile was developed that bends in both horizontal and vertical planes. This solution is completely integrated into the architecture of our building. On the facade of the shopping part of the complex, there are windows of irregular shapes for which we develop special louvered screens. These screens will be translucent, but from a certain distance, the video content will be visible on them.",

The lighting constantly changes shades due to a big amount of the programmed patterns. In case of necessity, colors can be tuned in themes of public holidays or any other events.",

The spatial interactive media sculpture was created to resemble the image of a human's heart. Recyclables used as a material were wastes from the footwear production. We combined different principles of lighting: an internal light from colored multi-channel lamps under different angles, a controllable outer light, and a 3d-mapping projection. Using 3d-mapping and internal lamps the sculpture became a stencil for interesting shadows. All the installation was tied to a single media server and accompanied by the audio content, which recreated the heartbeat on the background of meditative music. In addition, the sculpture was interactive. Kinetic sensors, which reacted to human movement, were placed around it.",

Each niche, in fact, is a \"\"pixel\"\" in a pattern, but the pattern itself has low resolution while the pixels are big. That created a certain difficulty in creating content. As a result, the illumination of the shopping center \"\"Passage\"\" can be considered a pixel art of low resolution.",

The daylight scene is static and uses neutral tones; in the evening, however, the dynamics are added with more active color palette, and then it adds red in a nightclub mode, while the graffiti get supplemented by the content of different activity degrees to match the emotional state of one or another time of the day. 3D-mapping technology is used for animation of the graffiti. More than 30 variations of projections change themselves by special timings in consistency with common scenes of lighting. The backlight of the bar counter and the construction of scene and corridor are also dynamic and diverse. All of the lighting devices are controlled by a single specially designed system.",

For example, if along all the height of the facade, there will be an imitation of a waterfall, the cube will turn into a giant aquarium from which the water will fall loudly.
